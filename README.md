## Engineering Philosophy

> *Ship a working prototype as soon as possible. Validate the idea for the Product/Service. Generate proof of concept to learn quickly if this Product/Service have a strong or weak market-fit. If positive; Continue and Improve. If negative; Pivot.*

- Ship fast, iterate later.
- Ship quality code, learn continuously.
- Ship value, not complexity.
- Ship the minimum that works; expand from proof.
- Ship working prototypes before architectural debates.
