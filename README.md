## My Goals
Building Enterprise-grade, production-ready applications integrated with AI-Native code.

## My Philosophy 
<ul> 
  <li>Ship fast, iterate later.</li> 
  <li>Ship quality code, learn continuously.</li> 
  <li>Ship before you polish; polish what you ship.</li> 
  <li>Ship value, not complexity.</li> 
  <li>Ship daily progress, even if tiny.</li> 
  <li>Ship the minimum that works; expand from proof.</li> 
  <li>Ship small and increment, grand intentions alone aren't worth anything.</li> 
  <li>Ship working prototypes before architectural debates.</li> 
  <li>Ship small, ship soon, ship bad things, but do ship something, because perfect concepts can't be validated.</li> 
</ul>

## Professional Summary
Software Engineer and self-driven Python developer with 15+ years of experience in large-scale infrastructure and systems integration. Brings a strong engineering mindset to backend development — comfortable designing distributed systems, REST APIs, and automation pipelines from hands-on experience managing mission-critical networks at national scale. Experienced with Python scripting, system automation, and network programmability. Focus on backend architecture, databases, and cloud-native development. Seeking a backend or Python developer role in the EU; eligible for Employment Permit sponsorship (GEP / Critical Skills). Open to immediate relocation within Europe.

## Technical Skills
•	Languages & Scripting: Python, Bash/Shell scripting, YAML, JSON, XML
•	Backend & APIs: REST API design, automation pipelines, system integration, CLI tooling
•	Cloud & Infrastructure: Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), Linux server administration, Docker (familiar)
•	Databases: SQL basics, structured data handling, configuration databases
•	Networking & Protocols: TCP/IP, BGP, OSPF, MPLS, SD-WAN, IPv4/IPv6 — strong foundation for network-layer backend work
•	Tools & Practices: Git/GitHub, ITIL change management, CI/CD concepts, Agile/Scrum, JIRA, technical documentation
•	Environments: Linux (Ubuntu, CentOS), Windows Server, multi-vendor CLI (Huawei VRP, Cisco IOS, HP)

## Work Experience
**Huawei Technologies  |  Senior Network Automation Engineer  |  Dec 2024 – Present**
•	Developed and maintained Python automation scripts to streamline configuration deployment across 18,000+ switches and 7,000+ sites, reducing manual effort on large-scale rollouts.
•	Built tooling to automate data collection, health checks, and reporting for a national SD-WAN deployment covering 5,000 sites.
•	Designed and documented Proofs of Concept (PoCs) integrating automation pipelines into project delivery workflows for major clients (Caixa Econômica Federal, Bank of Brazil).
•	Collaborated with TAC/GTAC engineering teams to troubleshoot and resolve complex backbone incidents, applying systematic debugging methodologies transferable to software engineering.
•	Contributed to scope definition, technical documentation, and change management for multi-site infrastructure programs.
**Oi Fiber Carrier  |  Network Automation & Systems Integration Specialist  |  Jul 2023 – Dec 2024**
•	Automated recurring configuration tasks and network audit workflows using Python and Bash scripting, improving team efficiency in a high-volume NOC environment.
•	Built internal scripts to parse logs, correlate incidents, and generate structured technical reports for Caixa Econômica Federal's nationwide network.
•	Implemented security hardening policies and dynamic routing configurations across Cisco and HP routers using scripted deployment methods.
•	Maintained VLAN segmentation logic and documented network topology changes, applying version-control-style discipline to configuration management.
**Teledata  |  Systems & Automation Engineer  |  Dec 2022 – Jun 2023**
•	Developed operational runbooks and automation procedures for Asterisk/VoIP systems, reducing mean time to resolution on PBX incidents.
•	Integrated new features into Asterisk (dialplan scripting, IVR logic, unified messaging) — directly relevant to backend logic and event-driven programming.
•	Conducted performance audits and produced structured technical reports; mentored junior engineers on troubleshooting methodology.
**Stefanini  |  Backend & VoIP Systems Developer  |  Sep 2017 – Nov 2022**
•	Automated complex call-routing logic in Asterisk using dialplan and AGI scripting (Python/PHP), building custom IVR flows and integration hooks.
•	Led implementations of new PBX systems end-to-end, managing technical design, testing, and deployment — experience directly analogous to backend service delivery.
•	Mentored junior team members and produced internal documentation, establishing repeatable processes for configuration and incident response.
**A7 Telecom  |  Systems & Infrastructure Technician  |  Jan 2012 – Sep 2017**
•	Installed and commissioned datacom equipment and PABX systems across enterprise sites.
•	Performed network diagnostics and preventive maintenance, building deep understanding of low-level protocols and system behavior.
